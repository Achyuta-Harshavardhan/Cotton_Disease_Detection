# Cotton Disease Detection
1. In this project the disease of the cotton plant is detected using Transferlearning concept for images.
2. Transfer learning is nothng but freezing the layers of the inception net and training only the last layers based on the problem statement.
2. Inception net has got better accuracy compare with other networks like VGG16.
